## What is this?
This is a side project I started in high school while I was learning C. I really liked the language and I wanted to use it for something. In all our previous projects we had only used web technologies, and I wondered what other ways there were for developing an application other than HTML/CSS/JS. Eventually I got really interested in developing a native desktop app, but I had no idea how. So I went looking for a way to develop a cross-platform app and found gtk. After working on and off for about two years, this project is finally done. Well that's not really true; it's not exactly feature-complete. I wanted to finish it so I could jump into other projects. In the end I learned a lot. Using gobject gave me some insight into the magic of OO languages like C++ or Java, and concepts like virtual functions or polymorphism became that much clearer. I also learned about make and managed to write a simple makefile. So I'd say this project fulfilled its objective.
